  char padding;
}
```

## File Format

The SAN file format is fairly straight forward it contains a basic file header following with a list of all known actors within the game.

```cpp
struct lpd_t = {
  header_t header;
  actor_t actors[];
}

struct actor_t = {
  uint32 actor_id; // Actor ID as BE processed with a logical or of 0xA0F00000
  char actor_name[...0x0]; // This is the name of the actor which is null terminated
  char padding;
}
```

### Script section

The actors is an "encrypted" and can be decrypted using the following algorithm:

```cpp
  char decoded = encoded ^ 0x73
```
